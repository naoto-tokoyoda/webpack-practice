# webpack-practice

I am practicing how to use webpack in JavaScript and React. Here are some projects for this.



## What is the concept of Webpack?

- webpack is a module bundler.  
- It is a tool that combines multiple files into a single file.
- This will help developers to organize their code into smaller, reuseable modules.


## Why we use Webpack?

I think there are mainly two reasons:   
* Separating the files for each function will keep the code organized and increase development efficiency and maintainability.   
* If you try to load many js files on a single page, the number of requests will be that many, and it will take a long time. By consolidating them into a single file, only one request is made, which improves performance. performance can be improved.
